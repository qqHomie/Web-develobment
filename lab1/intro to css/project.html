            <p id="bor">In the sanatorium you can not only restore your psychological balance, but also improve your health. The healing air of the Pine Forest, saturated with oxygen and essential oils of coniferous trees, has powerful antibacterial properties that are vital for people with acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The tart pine aroma sets each guest of our places to rest in harmony with nature itself.
People go to Sosnovy Bor to relax and get rid of diseases of the musculoskeletal system, cardiovascular system, gynecological, urological, skin diseases, gastrointestinal tract, liver and biliary tract, and solve metabolic problems. Sosnovy Bor is also famous for its mineral water, and therefore it is considered the best and most visited balneological sanatorium in Kazakhstan.</p>
